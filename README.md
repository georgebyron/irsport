# About project

Project created from [this template](https://github.com/piotrgondek/react-basics).

Assumptions:

- IRS's (the club name) main content (events, photos, info etc) is placed in FB, so the page is not a blog
- because of this fact I decided to make one page website - a very ligh page which contains the most important info about the club (who is the trainer? when are the trainings? how much does it cost? where is it? how does the training look like?)
- each info is placed in separated section, there is strong contrast between sections (light/dark theme) so client is aware where is border between info
- mobile first - this web is for young ppl who want to get info about club quickly using phone
- a very visible contact section - the most important buttons: email, phone, map are always visible in mobile view
- socal media buttons - visible so client is able to visit e.g. FB which contains more info about club
- intro - I know from the interview that a lot of ppl like current intro (video)

# About project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

Jest tests was replaced with Cypress, in my opinin snapshot tests are better than unit tests for such small project like this one.

Eslint added, I like when my IDE fixes my small typoes and informs me about bigger ones.

Husky added, small automatization with git commands.

MUI used, awesome lib based on Material Design rules. It helps developing page because of rules from MD.
